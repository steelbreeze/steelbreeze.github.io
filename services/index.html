            <h2>Architecture capability mobilisation</h2>
            <p>Starting a new enterprise architecture capability from scratch can be a daunting task; we have done this many times and will tailor the architecture capability to the needs and context of your organisation. We will create job descriptions and assist in recruitment.</p>
            <h2>Architecture capability assessment</h2>
