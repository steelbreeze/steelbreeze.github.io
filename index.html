				<h3><a href="/ea">Enterprise architecture</a></h3>
				<p>We think of enterprise architecture as:
					<i>knowing what you have; knowing what you need; having a transition plan</i>. This applies to your business, information
					systems and technology architectures.</p>
				<p>Creating and operating a sustainable enterprise architecture capability within your organisation is a multi-faceted task,
					requiring strong stakeholder management and defining and implementing governance processes.</p>
				<p>A mature enterprise architecture practice is essential to a healthy information technology organisation and is an essential
					component of other transformational activities such as exploiting digital channels.</p>
				<p>We have extensive experience mobilising and running successful enterprise architecture teams within financial services.</p>

				<h3><a href="/da">Data architecture</a></h3>
				<p>The value of an enterpriseâ€™s data assets is finally being understood thanks to advances in analytics technology. However,
					analytics tools will always be constrained by the quality of data available and data scientists need a strong underlying
					semantic model to fully exploit this rich data resource.</p>
				<p>We have in-depth knowledge of banking data, associated lifecycles and interactions. We can assist you in building enterprise
					data models as a pre-cursor to analytical activities and other development and reengineering projects.</p>
