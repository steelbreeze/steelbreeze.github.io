                </h3>
                <p>We think of enterprise architecture as: <i>“knowing what you have; knowing what you need; having a transition plan”</i>. This applies to your business, information systems and technology architectures.</p>
                <p>Creating and operating a sustainable enterprise architecture capability within your organisation is a multi-faceted task, requiring strong stakeholder management and defining and implementing governance processes.</p>
                <p>A mature enterprise architecture practice is essential to a healthy information technology organisation and is an essential component of other transformational activities such as exploiting digital channels.</p>
                <p>We have extensive experience mobilising and running successful enterprise architecture teams within financial services.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>The value of an enterprise’s data assets is finally being understood thanks to advances in analytics technology. However, analytics tools will always be constrained by the quality of data available and data scientists need a strong underlying semantic model to fully exploit this rich data resource.</p>
                <p>We have in-depth knowledge of banking data, associated lifecycles and interactions. We can assist you in building enterprise data models as a pre-cursor to analytical activities and other development and reengineering projects.</p>
