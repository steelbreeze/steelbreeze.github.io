                requirements they place on the underlying information and its management.</p>

                <h2>Conceptual information modelling</h2>
                <p>We can build high-level conceptual models of the information within your enterprise. Conceptual information
                    modelling is concerned with breadth of scope, but at a level that is manageable and maintainable (typically
                    just significant business entities and their relationships). It is an essential starting point in data
                    architecture to contextualise later detailed logical and physical analysis.</p>
                <p>Depending on the size and scope of the organisation, it may be necessary to break the enterprise down into
                    domains of

                <h2>Logical data definition</h2>
                <p>Once a conceptual model is in place, detailed analysis and definition of entities is the next step. Often
                    part of a project, we can assist in logical data modelling. Here we add any sub-structure not covered
                    within the conceptual model and defining attributes.</p>
                <p>Other considerations are also brought to bear in the logical model, such as audit trail information and business
                    event information helping us understand why records change.</p>

                <h2>Data management process definition</h2>
                <p>When an application takes responsibility for being the data master (authority, system of record, golden source)
                    of a particular data set, it comes with a set of obligations to the enterprise that go beyond the applications
                    headline requirements. Understanding these obligations and engineering accordingly is crucial good data
                    quality within the enterprise. We can assist in defining policies that articulate these additional requirements.</p>

                <p>Be it data wrangling to discover answers to the questions you didn’t know you needed to ask, financial statement
                    reporting, or anything between, we can assist you to architect the necessary data preparation, aggregation
                    and visualisation.</p>

                <h2>Data governance</h2>
                <p>The art of data governance is finding the fine line between mature governance processes and maintaining enduring
                    engagement from core stakeholders. We can assist you in defining data governance processes and identifying
                    appropriate stakeholders within your organisation to act as data governance role holders.</p>
