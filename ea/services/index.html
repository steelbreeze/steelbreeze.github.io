                <a href="../../#AboutDavid">David</a>, the founder of Steelbreeze, is an accomplished architect; he has designed solutions for trading
                and risk applications, held technical and enterprise architecture roles, mobilised architecture organisations,
                and served as head of architecture at a multinational development bank.</p>
            <p>We believe that an enterprise architecture capability is essential to a healthy IT organisation; it provides
                a necessary counter-balance to other forces, resulting in efficient resource utilisation and responsible
                consideration towards other factors such a security and business continuity.</p>
            <p>Steelbreeze brings an architecture method that bridges the disciplines of solution and enterprise architecture
                and connects effectively with project governance processes.</p>
