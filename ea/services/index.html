        <h2>Architecture capability mobilisation</h2>
        <p>Starting a new enterprise architecture capability from scratch can be a daunting task; we have done this many times
            and will tailor the architecture capability to the needs and context of your organisation. We will assist you
            in defining and initiating any or all of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Architectural services catalogue;</li>
            <li>Application and technology portfolio management;</li>
            <li>Governance process definition, linked to other processes within your organisation;</li>
            <li>Architecture operating model design;</li>
            <li>Role profiles and recruitment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Strategy development</h2>
        <p>Whether itâ€™s digital transformation, cloud migration or cost management, we can create strategies for you that will
            understand your current situation and ambitions then provide a series of achievable steps in the form of a roadmap
            to take to realise the desired outcomes.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture capability assessment</h2>
        <p>We can assess your existing architecture capability for its maturity and effectiveness in alignment to your organisational
            needs and context.</p>
        <h2>Research and development</h2>
        <p>We will cut through the hype and assess new technologies, methods and processes to determine their value and place
            in your organisation; you will receive a study detailing the opportunities, costs and benefits.</p>
        <h2>Interim management</h2>
        <p>We can provide interim management services, be it architectural or IT departmental management, with sound financial,
