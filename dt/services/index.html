                change. We can assist you in strategy development, helping you: defining new business models; securely opening
                up your systems to new delivery channels; opening up and refactoring legacy applications.</p>

                <h2>Business model development</h2>
                <p>The starting point in any successfully enterprise architecture is a well-defined business architecture; it
                    is here that we codify enterprise objectives, and most importantly, the business processes that connect
                    the enterprise with its business partners.</p>
                <p>At the heart of any digital transformation initiative is a deep understanding of your business process interaction
                    with your clients, the channels you use to interact with them. Critical to success is separation of the
                    middle and back office processing from channel specifics within your operating model.</p>
                <p>The business model changes are not limited to just client facing changes, but internal supporting processes
                    may require revisiting in order to keep pace with business in the digital economy.</p>

                <h2>Delivery channels</h2>
                <p>The pace of technology innovation provides us with new opportunities to interact with not only client, but
                    other business partners such as suppliers in addition.</p>
                <p>We have experience of re-engineering perimeter networks to facilitate secure external access, implementing
                    API gateways for business-to-business and deploying modern
                    <i>lean web portals</i>.</p>

                <h2>Integration</h2>
                <p>Opening up your existing application assets to participate in digital transactions is the starting point
                    for your digital transformation journey. We have significant experience implementing enterprise service
                    busâ€™s in several major financial organisations.
                </p>
                <p>Coupled with the integration technology, the design of protocols between the client and your channel, and
                    then between your channels to your middle and back offices require careful design.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>Underpinning all the above is the provision of robust
                    <i>identity and access management</i>. This is both a business and technology problem: the former from a
                    process perspective and the latter selecting the tools and technologies. We have experience implementing
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0">SAML 2.0</a> and
                    <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenId Connect</a>.</p>
