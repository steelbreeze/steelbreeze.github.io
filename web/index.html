			<h1>Services</h1>
			<p>Steelbreeze is an independent consultancy providing IT Architecture services, with a deep domain knowledge of corporate
				and investment banking. We can offer you a wide variety of architectural services, with a grounded pragmatism.</p>
			<article>
				<h2>Enterprise architecture</h2>
				<p>At Steelbreeze, we think of enterprise architecture as linking the domains of business, information systems (application
					and data) and technology architecture coherently. By providing this traceability, you can ensure IT decision making
					is driven by your enterprise strategy. We bring an architectural model that can be tailored to your needs.</p>
				<p>Architecture lives or dies by the quality of its communication and engagement; we can assist you in developing effective
					architecture communications.</p>
				<p>We also ensure that robust governance processes are in place within your organisation to ensure compliance to architectural
					direction and standards.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Data architecture</h2>
				<p>The value of an enterprise’s data assets is finally being acknowledged thanks to advances in analytics technology.</p>
				<p>However, analytics will always be constrained by the quality of data available; data scientists need a strong underlying
					semantic model and quality data to truly exploit this rich business resource.</p>
				<p>We have in-depth knowledge of banking data, associated lifecycles and interactions. We can assist you in building enterprise
					data models as a pre-cursor to analytical activities and other development and reengineering projects.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Application architecture</h2>
				<p>Complex enterprises have an increasing demand for application support; from your core line of business, where you may
					have intellectual property to protect, to the applications that any organisation needs, such as finance and people management.</p>
				<p>We can help you catalogue your application, building capability models that will help you: determine the opportunities
					for sharing and reuse; understand total cost of ownership; make investment decisions.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Technology architecture</h2>
				<p>A modern enterprise relies on a wide variety of underlying tools and technologies. Left unchecked the diversity of these
					can lead to a large support burden; resulting in large numbers of small contracts with suppliers, a skills burden and
					interoperability issues.</p>
				<p>However, standards can stifle innovation and cause a gradual slide into legacy.</p>
				<p>The portfolio of technologies within your enterprise needs careful proactive management to ensure balance between these
					conflicting forces.</p>

					<h2>Information management in application design</h2>
